    <h1>Instructions for Use</h1>

    <h2>Capturing Wound Images</h2>

    <p>
    <ol>

        <li>Place a Swift HealX marker on intact skin, adjacent to the patient’s wound.</li>

        <li>From the Swift Skin and Wound camera screen, position the smartphone above the wound. A
            green overlay will "find" and position itself over the Swift HealX.
        </li>

        <li>If necessary, tap anywhere on the screen to focus the image. You can tap as many times
            as necessary until you are happy with the focus.

            (Optional) Depending on the lighting levels in the room, you can tap the torch icon to
            turn the flashlight on.
        </li>

        <li>Tap the shutter button at the bottom center of the screen. Swift Skin and Wound captures
            an image of the wound and takes you to the Area screen.
        </li>

        <li> The History tool will allow you to see a photo of the previous evaluation.</li>
    </ol>

    </p>

    <h2>Autodepth</h2>
    <p>
        Swift’s AutoDepth, an automated, non-contact method, allows for measurement of wound depth
        using the everyday smartphone. Not all organizations have AutoDepth enabled at a base level.
        You will not be able to use both AutoDepth and the Swift Ray 1 during the same evaluation.
        </br>
        You can’t use autodepth with the front facing camera.
    </p>

    <h2> Using Autodepth </h2>
    <p>
        When starting the Autodepth workflow you will be asked if the wound you are evaluating has
        measureable depth (a wound with greater depth than 0.1cm)

        <img src="images/measureabledepth.png">

    <ol>

        <li>If the wound with no measureable depth, tap no to start an evaluation with manual
            depth
        </li>
        <li>If the wound has depth, tap Yes.</li>
    </ol>

    After tapping yes, the Autodepth capture begins. To ensure that the Autodepth is captured
    correctly, please follow these steps:
    <ul>

        <li>Keep the wound in the center and moving the device to the left or right.</li>

        <li>Tilt and shift the device until a section of the white lines turn green.</li>

        <li>Return back to a center position. You should keep the wound centered at all times.</li>

        <li>Repeat until all sections turn green and a checkmark appears.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="images/autodepth.png">
    <h2> Area Screen </h2>
    <p> Once the wound image is captured, the next step is to add clinical information about the
        wound. This is done quickly and easily at the point-of-care, making charting fast and
        efficient.
        </br>
        </br>

        <b> Defining the wound area:</b>
        </br>
        </br>

        From the Area screen, use your finger to trace the outline of the wound. A green overlay
        will be displayed over the wound. Pinch to zoom in for a more detailed trace

        </br>
        </br>

        Tap Refine. The green overlay "snaps" around the wound image. Use the slider to find a
        refine level that you're satisfied with.

        </br>
        </br>

        Tap the Erase icon and scrub out parts you don't want or tap the Trace icon and circle the
        area you want to add.

        </br>
        </br>

        When you're satisfied, tap Done to transition to the Depth screen.
    </p>

    <h2> Setting the Head Direction </h2>

    <p>The head direction is required to complete an evaluation

    <ol>
        <li> To set the head-to-toe orientation, select the Head-to-Toe icon at the top right hand
            of the screen. Tap in the yellow circle to move the arrowhead on your screen to indicate
            where the patient’s head is, relative to the wound.
        </li>
        <li> Tap the Confirm Head Direction button when you’re done.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <img src="images/head.png">

    <h2> Wound Measurements </h2>
    <p>There are several key wound measurements you can include in your evaluations. The Swift Skin
        and Wound application is able to automatically calculate the values of multiple measurements
        but some need to be manually entered into your documentation.</p>

    <h2>Adding wound depth, undermining and tunnelling</h2>

    <h2>Adding wound depth(s):</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tap the Depth icon.</li>
        <li>Tap the position on the wound image where you want to document depth. A yellow dot
            appears indicating the spot where you are taking the depth measurement.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the depth in centimeters and tap Save.</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step as many times as needed in order to enter multiple depth
            measurements.
        </li>
        <li>Tap Done. The depth has measurement is added.</li>
    </ol>
    *If you completed AutoDepth, the depth measurement will appear here automatically.
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Undermining</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>If there is undermining present, tap the Undermining icon.</li>
        <li>Use your finger to draw a line – not circle – on the border of the wound where the
            undermining is. When you lift your finger, you’re prompted to enter the undermining
            depth.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the undermining depth in centimetres and tap Save.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have indicated all the areas of undermining.</li>
        <li>Tap Done. The Undermining measurement is added.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <img src="images/undermining.png">

    <h2> Adding Tunnelling </h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>If there is tunnelling present, tap the Tunnelling icon.</li>
        <li>Use your finger to draw the tunnel on the wound. Draw in a straight line – not a circle
            – starting from the inside of the wound and cutting across the wound border to indicate
            the direction of the tunnel. When you lift your finger, you’ll be prompted to enter the
            depth of the tunnelling.
        </li>
        <li>Enter the tunnel depth in centimetres and tap Save.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have indicated all the areas of tunnelling.</li>
        <li>Tap Done. The tunnelling measurement is added.</li>
    </ol>
    Once all Depth, Undermining and Tunnelling measurement have been captured, you can tap the Step
    2/2 button and move to the Measurement screen.
    </p>
    <img src="images/tunnelling.png">

    <h2> Measurement Screen</h2>
    <p>The measurement screen gives you an opportunity to review the evaluation before proceeding to
        the Evaluation Summary. From here, you can go back retake the photo, edit the trace on the
        Area Screen, or go back to the Depth screen to edit your Depth, Undermining and Tunnelling
        measurements.
        </br>
        </br>

        If you are satisfied with the photo, area and measurements, tap the Done button.
